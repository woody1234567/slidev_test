# The Elasticity of Demand

Economists use the concept of **elasticity** to measure how responsive quantity demanded or supplied is to changes in one of its determinants (such as price, income, or prices of related goods).

<MathBox title="Key Definitions">

- **Elasticity:** responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in determinants.

</MathBox>

<MathBox title="The Price Elasticity of Demand">

- Demand is **elastic** when quantity demanded responds substantially to price changes.
- Demand is **inelastic** when quantity demanded responds only slightly.
- The law of demand: a fall in price raises quantity demanded.

</MathBox>

# Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand

**Availability of Close Substitutes**

Goods with more close substitutes have more elastic demand.
- Consumers can easily switch when price rises.
- Example: **butter vs. margarine** — high elasticity.
- Example: **eggs** — fewer substitutes, therefore less elastic.

**Necessities vs. Luxuries**

- Necessities ⟹ **inelastic demand**.
- Luxuries ⟹ **elastic demand**.
- Example: **doctor visits** are necessities; quantity demanded changes little with price.
- Example: **sailboats** are luxuries; demand drops substantially when price rises.

# Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand (cont.)

**Definition of the Market**

Elasticity depends on how narrowly the market is defined.
- Narrow markets ⟹ **more elastic**.
- Broad markets ⟹ **more inelastic**.
- Example: **food** (broad) ⟹ inelastic.
- Example: **ice cream** (narrow) ⟹ elastic.
- Example: **vanilla ice cream** (very narrow) ⟹ highly elastic.

**Time Horizon**

Demand becomes more elastic over longer time horizons.
- Short run: quantity demanded changes only slightly.
- Long run: consumers adapt—buy efficient cars, relocate, use public transport.
- Example: **gasoline** becomes more elastic over time.

# Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand

Economists measure the price elasticity of demand as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price:

$$\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{\%\ \text{change in quantity demanded}}{\%\ \text{change in price}}$$

<MathBox title="Key Notes">

- Because price and quantity demanded move in opposite directions, calculated elasticity is often negative.
- Economists typically drop the minus sign and use the **absolute value**.
- A larger elasticity (in absolute value) means demand is more responsive to price changes.

</MathBox>

---
layout: default
---

# Example

<Keynote title="Example">

A 10% increase in the price of ice cream causes quantity demanded to fall by 20%.

$$\text{Elasticity} = \frac{-20\%}{10\%} = -2$$

Using the absolute value convention: $|\text{Elasticity}| = 2$.

</Keynote>

# The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Compute Elasticity

When calculating elasticity between two points, the direction of movement creates different percentage changes. Example:

- Point A: Price = $4, Quantity = 120
- Point B: Price = $6, Quantity = 80

<Keynote title="The Problem">

- **A → B:** Price rises 50%, Quantity falls 33% ⟹ Elasticity = 33/50 = 0.66
- **B → A:** Price falls 33%, Quantity rises 50% ⟹ Elasticity = 50/33 = 1.5

Percentage change depends on the chosen base ⟹ inconsistent results.

</Keynote>

---
layout: default
---

# Midpoint Method Formula

Using the midpoint method, changes are measured relative to averages:

<MathBox title="Midpoint Method Solution">

Use the midpoint (average) of initial and final values as the base for percentage changes.

$$\text{Midpoint of price:}\; \frac{4+6}{2} = 5 \qquad \text{Midpoint of quantity:}\; \frac{120+80}{2} = 100$$

</MathBox>

<Keynote title="Midpoint Percentage Changes">

- Price change: $\frac{6-4}{5} \times 100 = 40\%$
- Quantity change: $\frac{80-120}{100} \times 100 = -40\%$

Elasticity is the same in both directions: $|-40\% / 40\%| = 1$.

</Keynote>

---
layout: default
---

# Midpoint Elasticity Formula

<MathBox title="Midpoint Elasticity Formula">

$$\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{(Q_2 - Q_1) / [(Q_2 + Q_1)/2]}{(P_2 - P_1) / [(P_2 + P_1)/2]}$$

</MathBox>

This method ensures the same elasticity regardless of direction of movement.

---
layout: default

# The Variety of Demand Curves

Economists classify demand curves based on their elasticity:
- **Elastic** demand: elasticity $> 1$ (quantity changes more than price).
- **Inelastic** demand: elasticity $< 1$ (quantity changes less than price).
- **Unit elastic**: elasticity $= 1$.

<Keynote title="Slope and Elasticity">

- Flatter demand curve ⟹ **more elastic**.
- Steeper demand curve ⟹ **less elastic**.

Elasticity measures responsiveness to price changes, so curve shape visually reflects elasticity.

# Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand

Total revenue (TR) is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers: **TR** = $P \times Q$. Graphically, under a demand curve, the rectangle with height $P$ and width $Q$ has area $P \times Q$ = total revenue.

<div class="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <img src="./chap5/T6.png" class="w-3/4" alt="Total Revenue Rectangle" />
</div>

---
layout: default

# Rectangle Under Demand Curve

<Keynote title="Numerical Illustration">

If $P = \$4$ and $Q = 100$, then $\text{TR} = \$400$. Moving along the demand curve from $P = \$4, Q = 100$ to $P = \$5$:
- **Inelastic** case: $Q$ falls to $90$ ⟹ $\text{TR} = \$450$ (rises).
- **Elastic** case: $Q$ falls to $70$ ⟹ $\text{TR} = \$350$ (falls).

</Keynote>

<MathBox title="Intuition via Areas">

Price increase adds revenue on units still sold (area A) but loses revenue on foregone units (area B).
- If demand is **inelastic**, A $>$ B ⟹ TR rises.
- If demand is **elastic**, A $<$ B ⟹ TR falls.

# Price--TR Relationship: Summary Rules

- Use rectangles under the demand curve to visualize $TR = P \times Q$.
- Compare the gain from higher price (A) with the loss from lower quantity (B).
- Elasticity governs which area dominates.

<Keynote title="Key Rules Linking Price, Elasticity, and Total Revenue">

- If demand is **inelastic** $(|E_d| < 1)$: price and total revenue move in the **same** direction.
- If demand is **elastic** $(|E_d| > 1)$: price and total revenue move in **opposite** directions.
- If demand is **unit elastic** $(|E_d| = 1)$: total revenue is **constant** as price changes.

# Linear Demand Curve

A linear demand curve has a constant slope, but its **elasticity is not constant**. Slope measures absolute changes ($\Delta P / \Delta Q$), while elasticity measures **percentage** changes.

The midpoint method is used to compute elasticities along the curve. The table illustrates how elasticity changes from elastic → unit elastic → inelastic.

# Linear Demand Curve (cont.)

<Keynote title="Patterns from the Table">

- High price / low quantity ⟹ elasticity $> 1$ ⟹ **elastic**.
- Midpoint ($P=4$, $Q=6$) ⟹ elasticity $= 1$ ⟹ **unit elastic**.
- Low price / high quantity ⟹ elasticity $< 1$ ⟹ **inelastic**.

</Keynote>

<MathBox title="Total Revenue Pattern">

- When $P$ is low ⟹ demand is inelastic ⟹ raising price increases TR.
- When $P$ is high ⟹ demand is elastic ⟹ raising price decreases TR.
- At the midpoint ⟹ demand is unit elastic ⟹ TR is maximized.

# Other Demand Elasticities: Income Elasticity of Demand

Economists use additional elasticities to describe buyer behavior. The **income elasticity of demand** measures how quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes.

$$\text{Income Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{\%\ \text{change in quantity demanded}}{\%\ \text{change in income}}$$

---
layout: default
---

# Income Elasticity of Demand (cont.)

<Keynote title="Types of Goods by Income Elasticity">

- **Normal goods:** income ↑ ⟹ quantity demanded ↑ (positive income elasticity).
- **Inferior goods:** income ↑ ⟹ quantity demanded ↓ (negative income elasticity). Example: bus rides.

</Keynote>

<MathBox title="Variation among Normal Goods">

- **Necessities** (food, clothing): small income elasticity.
- **Luxuries** (caviar, diamonds): large income elasticity.

Consumers reduce luxury purchases more sharply when their incomes fall.

</MathBox>

# The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

The cross-price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good.

$$\text{Cross-Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \text{change in quantity demanded of good 1}}{\%\ \text{change in price of good 2}}$$

---
layout: default
---

# The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (cont.)

<Keynote title="Interpreting the Sign">

- **Positive elasticity** ⟹ goods are **substitutes**. Example: hamburgers and hot dogs.
- **Negative elasticity** ⟹ goods are **complements**. Example: computers and software.

</Keynote>

<MathBox title="Economic Intuition">

**Substitutes:**
Price of good 2 ↑ ⟹ demand for good 2 ↓ ⟹ demand for good 1 ↑.

**Complements:**
Price of good 2 ↑ ⟹ demand for good 2 ↓ ⟹ demand for good 1 ↓.

# 2. The Elasticity of Supply

---
layout: default
---

# The Elasticity of Supply

When producers receive a higher price, they are willing to supply more of a good. To move from qualitative to quantitative analysis, we use the concept of **elasticity of supply**.

<MathBox title="Definition: Price Elasticity of Supply">

A measure of how much the quantity supplied responds to a change in the price of a good, computed as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

</MathBox>

<Keynote title="Elastic vs. Inelastic Supply">

- **Elastic supply:** Quantity supplied responds substantially to price changes.
- **Inelastic supply:** Quantity supplied responds only slightly to price changes.

</Keynote>

---
layout: default
---

# The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants

A major determinant of the price elasticity of supply is the **flexibility of sellers**. Some goods, such as beachfront land, have very inelastic supply because increasing production is nearly impossible. By contrast, manufactured goods often have elastic supply because producers can adjust factory use in response to prices.

<Keynote title="Key Determinant: Time Horizon">

- **Short run:** Firms cannot easily change factory size; supply is inelastic.
- **Long run:** Firms can build or close factories; new firms can enter; supply becomes more elastic.

</Keynote>

---
layout: default
---

# Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply

Economists compute the **price elasticity of supply** as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

$$\text{Price elasticity of supply} = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}$$

---
layout: default
---

# Example: Milk Supply

<Keynote title="Example: Milk Supply">

When the price of milk increases from \$2.85 to \$3.15 per gallon, dairy farmers increase production from 9,000 to 11,000 gallons per month. Using the midpoint method:

- **Percentage change in price:** $\frac{3.15 - 2.85}{3.00} \times 100 = 10\%$
- **Percentage change in quantity supplied:** $\frac{11,000 - 9,000}{10,000} \times 100 = 20\%$

</Keynote>

---
layout: default
---

# Example: Milk Supply (cont.)

Therefore, Price elasticity of supply can be computed as:

$$\text{Price elasticity of supply} = \frac{20\%}{10\%} = 2$$

<MathBox title="Interpretation">

An elasticity of 2 means the quantity supplied responds proportionately twice as much as the price.

</MathBox>

---
layout: default
---

# The Variety of Supply Curves

Because the price elasticity of supply measures how responsive quantity supplied is to price, it is reflected in the shape of the supply curve.

- **Elastic** supply: elasticity $> 1$ (quantity changes more than price).
- **Inelastic** supply: elasticity $< 1$ (quantity changes less than price).
- **Unit elastic**: elasticity $= 1$.

<Keynote title="Slope and Elasticity">

- Flatter supply curve ⟹ **more elastic**.
- Steeper supply curve ⟹ **less elastic**.

# How the Price Elasticity of Supply Can Vary

**Supply Elasticity Varies Across Markets**
In some industries, elasticity is not constant along the supply curve. Firms may face unused capacity when output is low (making supply elastic), but once full capacity is reached, increasing output requires building new plants, making supply less elastic.

<div class="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <img src="./chap5/T15.png" class="w-1/2" alt="Varying Supply Elasticity" />
</div>

# How the Price Elasticity of Supply Can Vary (cont.)

<Keynote title="Low Output Region: Highly Elastic Supply">

When the price rises from \$3 to \$4 (a 29% increase), quantity supplied rises from 100 to 200 (a 67% increase).
**Elasticity $> 1$:** Quantity supplied responds proportionately more than price.

</Keynote>

<MathBox title="High Output Region: Inelastic Supply">

When the price rises from \$12 to \$15 (a 22% increase), quantity supplied rises only from 500 to 525 (a 5% increase).
**Elasticity $< 1$:** Quantity supplied responds proportionately less than price.

</MathBox>

These examples show that supply elasticity decreases as firms approach production capacity.

# Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers?

Imagine a Kansas wheat farmer. A new hybrid of wheat is discovered that increases output per acre by 20%. How does this affect farmers?

<MathBox title="Step 1: Which Curve Shifts?">

The new hybrid increases productivity, allowing farmers to produce more wheat at any price.
**The supply curve shifts to the right.**

</MathBox>

<MathBox title="Step 2: Direction of the Shift">

Supply increases from $S_1$ to $S_2$.
Quantity rises (100 → 110), and price falls (from \$3 → \$2).
Demand remains unchanged.

</MathBox>

This raises a key question:
**Does producing more wheat make farmers better off or worse off?**

# Impact of Technology on Wheat Market

<div class="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <img src="./chap5/T16.png" class="w-3/4" alt="Wheat Market Shift" />
</div>

---
layout: default
---

# Why More Wheat Can Lower Farmers' Income

Farmers' total revenue equals $\text{Price} \times \text{Quantity}$. A technological improvement affects both components:

- Quantity supplied increases (Q rises).
- Market price of wheat falls (P falls).

<Keynote title="Key: Demand for Wheat Is Inelastic">

Because basic food products have few substitutes, demand for wheat is inelastic. Thus, when price falls, **total revenue falls**.

</Keynote>

Example:
- Price falls significantly, from \$300 to \$220.
- Quantity sold rises only slightly.

**Result:** The new hybrid reduces total revenue for farmers.

---
layout: default
---

# Long-Run Impact on Farmers

If farmers are worse off, why do they use the new hybrid? Because each farmer takes the price as given and benefits individually by producing more. But when **all farmers adopt the new hybrid**, the increase in total supply drives the price downward, making all farmers worse off.

<MathBox title="Historical Perspective">

Over the past two centuries, advances in farm technology greatly increased food output. With inelastic food demand, higher supply led to falling farm revenues, pushing many workers out of farming.

</MathBox>

---
layout: default
---

# Policy Lessons

This also explains certain farm policies:
- Governments sometimes pay farmers **not** to plant crops.
- By reducing supply, prices rise and farm incomes increase.

<Keynote title="Important Insight">

What is good for consumers (cheaper food) may not be good for farmers. Improved technology benefits society but can hurt farmers.

# Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High?

In the 1970s, OPEC members attempted to raise the world price of oil by jointly reducing supply. This policy initially succeeded: oil prices rose dramatically in both the early and late 1970s.

However, OPEC struggled to maintain high prices. From 1982 to 1985, oil prices fell steadily, and by 1986 cooperation collapsed, causing a 45% plunge in price. Prices later returned to 1970 levels and fluctuated widely in the 21st century due to changing global demand.

---
layout: default
---

# Short-Run Early Success of OPEC

<Keynote title="Short-Run Elasticities Explain Early Success">

In the short run:
- Supply of oil is inelastic — extraction capacity cannot change quickly.
- Demand for oil is inelastic — consumers cannot easily change consumption habits.

Because both curves are steep, a leftward shift in supply (from $S_1$ to $S_2$) causes a **large increase in price**. Thus OPEC earned higher revenues even while selling less oil.

</Keynote>

# Short Run vs. Long Run: Oil Market

  <img src="./chap5/T17.png" class="w-full" alt="Short Run vs Long Run Oil Market" />
</div>

---
layout: default
---

# Short Run vs. Long Run: Why OPEC Eventually Failed

The long run tells a different story. Over time:

- Producers outside OPEC expand oil exploration and build new extraction capacity.
- Consumers adopt conservation methods and more efficient technologies.

Thus, both long-run supply and demand become **more elastic**. As panel (b) of the Figure indicated, the same shift in supply from $S_1$ to $S_2$ leads to only a small increase in price.

---
layout: default
---

# Long-Run Cartel Power

<MathBox title="Key Insight: Cartel Power Weakens Over Time">

- **In the short run:** Inelastic curves ⟹ large price increases ⟹ high OPEC revenue.
- **In the long run:** Elastic curves ⟹ small price increases ⟹ reduced profitability.

OPEC learned that raising prices is easier in the short run than in the long run.

# Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease Drug-Related Crime?

Illegal drug use causes many social problems, including addiction and drug-related crime. The U.S. government spends billions each year on drug interdiction to reduce the flow of illegal drugs.

To analyze this policy, we consider:
- Whether the supply or demand curve shifts.
- The direction of the shift.
- The resulting changes in equilibrium price and quantity.

<Keynote title="Effect of Drug Interdiction">

Interdiction targets **sellers**, not users. By raising the cost of smuggling and reducing available supply, the supply curve shifts left from $S_1$ to $S_2$.

</Keynote>

layout: two-cols

# Drug Interdiction Results

Equilibrium outcomes:
- Price rises from $P_1$ to $P_2$.
- Quantity falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$.

Thus, **drug use decreases**.

# Why Drug Interdiction May Increase Crime

A key question: What happens to the **total amount of money drug users pay**? This depends on the elasticity of demand for drugs.

<MathBox title="Demand for Drugs Is Inelastic">

Because addiction makes consumers unresponsive to price changes, the demand curve is steep. When price rises, total revenue $P \times Q$ **increases**.

</MathBox>

Consequences:
- Drug users now spend more to support their addiction.
- Many addicts may resort to theft or violent crime to obtain money.

**Thus, drug interdiction may reduce drug use but increase drug-related crime.**

# Demand Reduction Through Drug Education

Successful drug education shifts the demand curve left from $D_1$ to $D_2$.

Results:
- Equilibrium quantity falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$.
- Price falls from $P_1$ to $P_2$.
- Total revenue $P \times Q$ also falls.

# Policy Insight

<Keynote title="Policy Insight">

Unlike interdiction, demand reduction lowers both **drug use** and **drug-related crime**.

</Keynote>

Long-run considerations:
- Demand may be more elastic over time.
- Interdiction may increase crime in the short run but decrease it in the long run.
