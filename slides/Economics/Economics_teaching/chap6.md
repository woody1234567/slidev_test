# Price Controls: The Ice Cream Market Example

Consider a competitive market for ice cream with no government regulation. In equilibrium, the price adjusts to balance supply and demand, so the quantity buyers want to purchase equals the quantity sellers want to sell. Suppose the equilibrium price is $3 per cone.

<MathBox title="Equilibrium Outcome">

At the equilibrium price, the market clears:
- Buyers purchase exactly what sellers produce.
- No shortages or surpluses exist.

</MathBox>

Some groups are dissatisfied with this outcome. Ice-cream consumers argue that $3 is too high, while ice-cream producers argue that $3 is too low and reduces their income. Both groups lobby the government to intervene by controlling prices.

# Price Controls

<MathBox title="Price Controls">

- **Price Ceiling:** a legal maximum price, imposed to help buyers.
- **Price Floor:** a legal minimum price, imposed to help sellers.

</MathBox>

These policies prevent prices from adjusting freely and lead to different market outcomes.

# How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes

When the government imposes a **price ceiling**, two outcomes are possible, depending on whether the ceiling is above or below the equilibrium price.

::left::

**Case 1: Price Ceiling Is Not Binding**
- Example: Price ceiling = $4, equilibrium price = $3.
- The market price is below the ceiling.
- The ceiling has **no effect** on price or quantity.
- The market reaches equilibrium normally.

# How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes (cont.)

::left::

**Case 2: Price Ceiling Is Binding**
- Example: Price ceiling = $2, equilibrium price = $3.
- The ceiling is a **binding constraint**.
- The market price cannot rise to equilibrium.
- Quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied.

# Shortages and Rationing under a Binding Price Ceiling

When a binding price ceiling is imposed, the market price equals the ceiling. At this lower price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied.

<MathBox title="Market Outcome">

- Quantity demanded: 125 cones
- Quantity supplied: 75 cones
- **Shortage: 50 cones**

</MathBox>

Because prices can no longer ration goods, other rationing mechanisms emerge.

---
layout: default
---

# Shortages and Rationing (cont.)

<Keynote title="Rationing Mechanisms">

- Long waiting lines
- First-come, first-served
- Seller favoritism or discrimination

</Keynote>

These outcomes are often inefficient and potentially unfair. In contrast, free markets ration goods efficiently through prices.

# Case Study: Lines at the Gas Pump

In 1973, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of crude oil. Because crude oil is a key input in gasoline production, higher oil prices increased production costs and reduced the supply of gasoline.

<Keynote title="Initial Situation">

- Before the oil price increase, the equilibrium price of gasoline was below the price ceiling.
- The price ceiling was **not binding**.
- The gasoline market functioned normally.

</Keynote>

Many people blamed OPEC for the long lines at gas stations. However, economists argue that government price controls played a central role.

# Case Study: Lines at the Gas Pump (cont.)

<MathBox title="Key Question">

If oil prices rose, why didn’t gasoline prices adjust to clear the market?

</MathBox>

<div class="flex justify-center mt-4">

</div>

# Price Ceilings, Supply Shocks, and Shortages

When the price of crude oil increased, the supply of gasoline shifted left from $S_1$ to $S_2$.

**What Went Wrong?**
- In an unregulated market, the price would rise from $P_1$ to $P_2$.
- The price ceiling prevented the price from increasing.
- The price ceiling became **binding**.

At the regulated price:
- Quantity demanded = $Q_D$
- Quantity supplied = $Q_S$
- **Shortage = $Q_D - Q_S$**

<Keynote title="Lesson from the Gasoline Market">

When the government imposes a binding price ceiling during a negative supply shock, severe shortages and long waiting lines can result.

# How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes

A **price floor** is a legal minimum price set by the government. Like price ceilings, price floors attempt to control market outcomes.

::left::

<MathBox title="Case 1: Non-Binding Price Floor">

- Example: Price floor = $2, equilibrium price = $3.
- The equilibrium price is above the floor.
- The price floor has **no effect**.
- The market reaches equilibrium naturally.

</MathBox>

<div class="flex justify-center mt-8">
  <img src="./chap6/T4.png" class="w-full" alt="Non-binding Price Floor" />
</div>

layout: two-cols
---

# How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes (cont.)

::left::

<Keynote title="Case 2: Binding Price Floor">

- Example: Price floor = $4, equilibrium price = $3.
- The floor is a **binding constraint**.
- The market price cannot fall to equilibrium.
- Quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded.

</Keynote>

::right::

<div class="flex justify-center mt-8">

# Surpluses under a Binding Price Floor

When a binding price floor is imposed, the market price equals the floor.

<MathBox title="Market Outcome">

- Quantity supplied: 120 cones
- Quantity demanded: 80 cones
- **Surplus: 40 cones**

</MathBox>

At the price floor, some sellers are unable to sell their goods. As a result, alternative rationing mechanisms emerge.

<Keynote title="Rationing under a Price Floor">

- Sellers compete for buyers
- Favoritism or personal connections may matter
- Goods may not go to buyers who value them most

</Keynote>

# The Minimum Wage

The **minimum wage** is a legal minimum price for labor. It is an important example of a **price floor**.

<MathBox title="Definition and Purpose">

- Minimum-wage laws set the lowest wage employers may legally pay.
- First introduced in the United States in 1938.
- Intended to ensure workers a minimally adequate standard of living.

</MathBox>

In the labor market:
- Workers determine the supply of labor.
- Firms determine the demand for labor.
- Without intervention, wages adjust to balance supply and demand.

# Minimum Wage and Unemployment

If the minimum wage is set **above** the equilibrium wage, it becomes a **binding price floor**.

<MathBox title="Market Outcome">

- Wage cannot fall to equilibrium.
- Quantity of labor supplied exceeds quantity demanded.
- The result is **unemployment**.

</MathBox>

The minimum wage:
- Raises incomes for workers who keep their jobs.
- Reduces job opportunities for some workers.

# Evidence and Debate over the Minimum Wage

<Keynote title="Who Is Most Affected?">

The minimum wage is most likely to be binding for:
- Low-skilled workers
- Inexperienced workers
- Teenagers

</Keynote>

Studies of the teenage labor market find that:
- A 10% increase in the minimum wage
- Reduces teenage employment by about 1–3%.

# Evidence and Debate over the Minimum Wage (cont.)

<Keynote title="Why the Effect Is Limited">

- Not all workers earn the minimum wage.
- Enforcement is imperfect.
- Some wages are already above the minimum.

</Keynote>

<MathBox title="The Ongoing Debate">

- **Supporters:** Raise incomes of the working poor.
- **Opponents:** Cause unemployment and are poorly targeted.

</MathBox>

Economists remain divided on whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

# How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes

Suppose the government levies a $0.50 tax on sellers of ice-cream cones. To analyze the effect, we follow three steps.

**Step 1: Which Curve Is Affected?**
- The tax is levied on sellers, not buyers.
- Quantity demanded at each price is unchanged.
- The **demand curve does not shift**.
- The tax makes selling ice cream less profitable.

**Step 2: Direction and Size of the Shift**
- The tax raises the cost of producing and selling ice cream.
- Quantity supplied falls at every price.
- The **supply curve shifts left (upward)**.
- The shift is exactly equal to the size of the tax ($0.50).

# Taxes on Sellers: New Equilibrium and Incidence

After the supply curve shifts, the market reaches a new equilibrium.

**Step 3: New Equilibrium**
- Price paid by buyers rises from $3.00 to $3.30.
- Quantity sold falls from 100 to 90 cones.
- The size of the market shrinks.

Although sellers send the entire tax to the government, buyers and sellers share the burden.

<Keynote title="Tax Incidence">

- Buyers pay $0.30 more per cone.
- Sellers receive $2.80 after tax ($3.30 - $0.50).
- Both buyers and sellers are worse off.

</Keynote>

- Taxes discourage market activity.
- Taxes reduce the quantity traded.

# How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes

Suppose the government levies a $0.50 tax on buyers of ice-cream cones. To analyze the effect, we again follow three steps.

**Step 1: Which Curve Is Affected?**
- The tax is levied on buyers, not sellers.
- Sellers face the same incentives at any given price.
- The **supply curve does not change**.
- Buyers must now pay a tax in addition to the market price.

**Step 2: Direction and Size of the Shift**
- The tax makes buying ice cream less attractive.
- Quantity demanded falls at every price.
- The **demand curve shifts left (downward)**.
- The shift equals the size of the tax ($0.50).

# Taxes on Buyers: New Equilibrium and Implications

After the demand curve shifts, the market reaches a new equilibrium.

**Step 3: New Equilibrium**
- Market price falls from $3.00 to $2.80.
- Quantity sold falls from 100 to 90 cones.
- The size of the market shrinks.

Although sellers receive a lower market price, buyers pay a higher **effective price**.

<Keynote title="Tax Incidence">

- Sellers receive $2.80 per cone.
- Buyers pay $3.30 including the tax.
- Buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax.

# Can Congress Distribute the Burden of a Payroll Tax?

A **payroll tax** is a tax on wages paid to workers. An important example in the United States is the **FICA tax**, which funds Social Security and Medicare.

<Keynote title="Key Facts">

- Payroll taxes are levied on labor income.
- In 2013, the total FICA tax was 15.3% of earnings.
- By law, half is paid by firms and half by workers.

</Keynote>

This legal division raises an important question: Who actually bears the burden of the payroll tax?

# Payroll Tax

A payroll tax can be analyzed as a tax on labor, where the price is the wage.

<div class="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <img src="./chap6/T9.png" class="w-3/4" alt="Payroll Tax" />
</div>

# Payroll Taxes and Tax Incidence

- The tax creates a **wedge** between:
    - the wage firms pay, and
    - the wage workers receive.
- Wages paid by firms rise.
- Wages received by workers fall.

<Keynote title="Key Lesson of Tax Incidence">

- Workers and firms share the burden of the tax.
- The division of the burden does **not** depend on how the law assigns the tax.
- The same outcome would occur if the tax were levied entirely on workers or firms.

</Keynote>

Lawmakers cannot easily dictate who bears the burden of a tax; market forces determine tax incidence.

# Elasticity and Tax Incidence

When a tax is imposed, buyers and sellers share the burden. The key question is how that burden is divided.

<MathBox title="What Determines Tax Incidence?">

- The division of the tax burden does **not** depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers.
- It depends on the **relative elasticity** of supply and demand.

</MathBox>

<Keynote title="Two Key Cases">

- **Elastic supply, inelastic demand** ⟹ Buyers bear most of the tax.
- **Inelastic supply, elastic demand** ⟹ Sellers bear most of the tax.

</Keynote>

# Who Bears More of the Tax Burden?

The two panels lead to a general lesson.

**A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.**

<MathBox title="Economic Intuition">

- Elasticity measures how easily buyers or sellers can leave the market.
- The side with fewer alternatives is less willing to leave.
- That side must bear more of the tax burden.

</MathBox>

- In labor markets, labor supply is often less elastic than labor demand.
- As a result, workers tend to bear most of the burden of payroll taxes.

# Case Study: Who Pays the Luxury Tax?

In 1990, Congress adopted a luxury tax on items such as yachts, private airplanes, jewelry, and expensive cars.

<Keynote title="Policy Goal">

- Raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay.
- Tax goods primarily consumed by the rich.
- Make the tax system more progressive.

</Keynote>

At first glance, taxing luxury goods seemed like a logical way to tax wealthy consumers. However, once supply and demand responded, the outcome was very different from what lawmakers intended.

---
layout: default
---

# Elasticity Explains the Outcome of the Luxury Tax

<MathBox title="Market Elasticities">

- Demand for yachts is **elastic**.
- Wealthy buyers have many good alternatives.
- Supply of yachts is relatively **inelastic** in the short run.
- Yacht builders and workers have fewer alternatives.

</MathBox>

<Keynote title="Tax Incidence Result">

- Most of the tax burden falls on producers.
- Firms receive a much lower price.
- Workers in luxury industries suffer income losses.

</Keynote>

As a result, the burden of the luxury tax fell more on workers than on wealthy consumers. Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993.
